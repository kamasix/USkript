**USkript** is a simple, intuitive scripting language designed specifically for Unturned servers based on OpenMod. It allows server owners to modify server behavior using simple text files (`.usk`) without needing to compile C# plugins.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **No compilation** - edit `.usk` files and reload with `/usk reload`
- ✅ **Simple language** - syntax inspired by Python and Minecraft Skript
- ✅ **Safe layer** - controlled access to server functions
- ✅ **Hot reload** - reload without server restart
- ✅ **Extensible** - ability to add custom actions and events

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
- Unturned Server
- OpenMod installed on the server
- .NET Standard 2.1

### Installation Steps

1. Download the latest USkript release from [Releases](https://github.com/kamasix/USkript/releases)
2. Copy `USkript.dll` to the `OpenMod/Plugins/` folder
3. Start the server - the plugin will automatically create the `scripts/` folder
4. Done!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First Script

Create a file `scripts/welcome.usk`:

```python
# welcome.usk - Welcome players on join

event player_join(player):
    message player "Welcome to the server, {player.name}!"
    heal player
    feed player
    give player "15" 5
    broadcast "Player {player.name} joined the game!"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

USkript consists of three main layers:

### 1. Core (USkript.Core)
- **Models/** - AST (Node, EventNode, IfNode, ActionNode, ScriptFile)
- **Parsing/** - ScriptParser - parses `.usk` files to AST tree
- **Runtime/** - Execution engine:
  - `ISkriptPlayer` - player abstraction
  - `SkriptContext` - execution context
  - `USkriptInterpreter` - executes actions and conditions
  - `ScriptManager` - manages loaded scripts
  - `USkriptEngine` - main engine

### 2. OpenMod Adapter (USkript.OpenMod)
- **OpenModSkriptPlayer** - `ISkriptPlayer` implementation for OpenMod
- **OpenModEnvironmentAdapter** - OpenMod environment adapter
- OpenMod events mapping → USkript

### 3. Plugin (USkript.cs)
- Main OpenMod plugin
- Event subscriptions (`player_join`, `player_chat`, `player_death`)
- Integration with OpenMod DI
